\subsection{2D geometric bin-packing}

In the 2D geometric bin-packing problem, each item $i$ is a rectangle of width $w(i)$
and height $h(i)$. The bin is a rectangle of width $W$ and height $H$.
We have to compute an axis-parallel packing of the rectangles into the minimum number of bins.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{coffman1980performance}]
The Next-Fit-Decreasing-Height (NFDH) algorithm is 4-\asymAppx.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[\cite{caprara2008}]
The $\hdh_k$ algorithm is $T_k$-\asymAppx{} for 2D geometric bin-packing,
where $T_{\infty} := \lim_{k \to \infty} T_k \approx 1.6910$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{optional}
\begin{theorem}[\cite{JansenP2013}]
For any $\eps > 0$, there exists a $(1.5+\eps)$-\asymAppx{}
algorithm for 2D geometric bin-packing.
\end{theorem}
