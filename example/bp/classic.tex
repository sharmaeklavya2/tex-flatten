\subsection{Classic bin-packing}

In the classic bin-packing problem, each item is represented as a real number
from the interval $(0, 1]$, and a set of items fit into a bin if their sum is at most 1.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{johnson1974worst}]
The number of bins used by the Next-Fit algorithm to pack items $I$ is at most
$2\ceil{\opt(I)}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{johnson1974worst}]
The First-Fit algorithm is 1.7-\asymAppx.
\end{theorem}
